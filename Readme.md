## Photo Mapper
Put pictures in a database on a map. Images displayed using Magnific Popup JS library

To do:
* Delete img and thumbnail from FS after DB deletion
* Allow uploading images through UI -- need the 'C' in CRUD
* Item not quite scrolling to top of list on gallery click
* Improve pin jittering
* Try to add stuff to map that's not actually geo-tagged based on time
* Album label in heading
* User accounts
