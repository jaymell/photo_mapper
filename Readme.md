## Photo Mapper
Put pictures in a database on a map

To do:
* Accurately size, center, zoom, orient photos
* How scatter pins enough so they're distinguishable but still mostly accurately positioned... alternately, find clusters of pins and zoom/center all of them
* List them on the left, somewhere, sub-sorted by date and/or location
*Add in stuff that's not actually geo-tagged based on time
