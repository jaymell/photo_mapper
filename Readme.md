## Photo Mapper
Put pictures in a database on a map. Images displayed using Magnific Popup JS library

####To do:
* Save pin images instead of linking to them
* Remove jittering completely (or improve it sificantly)
* Try thumbnail list horizontal on bottom
* Album label in heading
* Landing page

#### Further off
* Upload images via HTTP
* User accounts in DB
* Photos divided by collection
* DB needs to keep track of static image filing and serve that out with dynamic routes
* Try to add stuff to map that's not actually geo-tagged based on time ??
