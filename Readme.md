## Photo Mapper
Put pictures in a database on a map. Images displayed using Magnific Popup JS library

To do:
* Center on selected pin when choosing picture on left,
if applicable
  * This tends to not be helpful in practice... 
just confusing
* Server-side image rotation
  * can do this with Python PIL
* Remove photos that suck
* Improve pin jittering
* Animate scrolling to selected item in list
* Try to add stuff to map that's not actually geo-tagged based on time
* Album label in heading
* User accounts
* Quick way to click through pictures 
  * Working, but makes the pin/list item
color changes confusing and pointless since
images in gallery don't affect those
* Set map labels on by default
* Look decent on phone
