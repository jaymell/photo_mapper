## Photo Mapper
Put pictures in a database on a map. 
Images displayed using PhotoSwipe -- www.photoswipe.com

####To do:
* Save pin images instead of linking to them
* Try thumbnail list horizontal on bottom instead of top
* Album label in heading
* Landing page
* Fix distortion in square images

#### Further off
* Upload images via HTTP
* User accounts in DB
* Photos divided by collection
* DB needs to keep track of static image filing and serve that out with dynamic routes
* Try to add stuff to map that's not actually geo-tagged based on time ??
