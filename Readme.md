## Photo Mapper
Put pictures in a database on a map. Images displayed using Magnific Popup JS library

To do:
* Show something to indicate which photo in list
is currently selected
* Sort photos in list
* Way to fix mis-rotated photos
* Way to remove photos that suck
* Adjust jitter of pins based on zoom level
* Add in stuff that's not actually geo-tagged based on time
* Album label used (in heading?)
* Possible 2nd map to show macro vs country-level zoom
