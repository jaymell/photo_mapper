## Photo Mapper
Put pictures in a database on a map through sane Rest-y API 
Images displayed using PhotoSwipe -- www.photoswipe.com

####To do:
* Serve _all_ static content from s3
* nginx proxy
* Save pin images instead of linking to them
* Try thumbnail list horizontal on bottom instead of top
* Album label in heading
* Landing page
* Fix distortion in square images

#### Further off
* Try to add stuff to map that's not actually geo-tagged based on time... maybe
